    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <img src="assets/images/AmericanFlag.jpg" alt="Nick Oetinger" style="width:150px; height:200px">
    <p>My name is Nick Oetinger. I was born in Buffalo, NY, and moved to Charlotte, NC in July of 2018.
    </p>
    <p>I attended the State University of New York at Oswego from 2010-2015. While at SUNY Oswego, I earned a Bachelors of Science in Technology Education, and a Masters of Science in Education. I graduated with Cum Laude honors.
        In addition to my studies, I was a long distance runner on the varsity Cross Country and Track teams from 2011-2015. My graduate year, I was voted Team Captain by my teammates. 
    </p>
    <p>After graduating from SUNY Oswego in May of 2015, I started my professional career as a Technology and Engineering Education teacher. I spent three years at Susquehanna Valley High School as the sole Technology Teacher. 
    While at SVHS, I built the Technology Education program from the ground up. I created and taught five different classes for students in grades 9-12 that covered a plethora of content areas.
    In addition to teaching, I was also the Head Coach of the Indoor Track Team, Volunteer Assistant Coach on the Cross Country and Outdoor Track Teams, and a part-time Bartender at a local pub, Tom & Marty's. 
    </p>
    <p>At the conclusion of my third year as a teacher, I decided to try my luck at a different career and move to Charlotte, North Carolina. 
    I was able to earn a job as an Application Technician at Duncan-Parnell in their 3D Printing and Rapid Prototyping Division. My job responsibilities include 3D printing files for customers, as well as managing and maintaining our customers 3D printers.
    Currently, while working at Duncan-Parnell, I am enrolled in a Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp at UNC Charlotte. I hope to learn even more skills from this bootcamp to make myself more marketable and earn a job as a Developer.
